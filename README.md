# Face-Detection Project

## Overview
This project implements a face detection system using OpenCV2 for capturing images, labelme for annotating images, and Albumentations for image augmentation. The dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets for training and evaluation purposes.

## Components

### 1. `get-images.py`
This script captures images from the video feed using OpenCV2 and assigns a unique image name using UUID.

### 2. `labelme`
[labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme) is a graphical image annotation tool used in this project to create annotations for the captured images. A rectangle bounding box is created around the face for annotation purposes.

### 3. `split_data.py`
The images and annotations generated by `get-images.py` and `labelme` are split into train, test, and validation sets. The split ratio is 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation.

### 4. `image_augmentation.py`
This script utilizes Albumentations, a popular image augmentation library, to augment the images. Augmentations include random cropping, horizontal and vertical flipping, and random changes to brightness, contrast, gamma, and RGB shift.

## Usage

1. **Capturing Images**: Run `get-images.py` to capture images from the video feed. Images will be saved with unique names using UUID.
2. **Annotation**: Use labelme to annotate the captured images by creating bounding boxes around the faces.
3. **Splitting Data**: Run `split_data.py` to split the annotated images and their annotations into train, test, and validation sets.
4. **Image Augmentation**: Apply image augmentation using `image_augmentation.py` to increase the diversity of the dataset for better model training.
